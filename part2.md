# Creating and editing files

You can create an empty file with the command `touch`.

Let's try it out!
1. Make sure you're in your folder without our workshop folder.
2. Create a file called `commands.txt` with:

```bash
touch commands.txt
```
## Reading a file

You can print the contents of a file to your terminal with `cat` followed by the file. 
This is most helpful for small human readable files. If your file is large, you can print
only the top few lines with `head` or the bottom few lines with `tail` both of which take 
the filename as an argument. If you would like to see 

Our commands.txt file is currently empty so let's put something in it before we take a 
look.
